        <h2>Usage</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Loot master is looting a corpse.</li>
            <li>If there is loot that can be distributed via master loot, the loot distribution will start.</li>

            <li>After selecting a loot option by clicking on it, you will see a list of players along with their decision.</li>
